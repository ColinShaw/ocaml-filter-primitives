This is just a collection of OCaml fragments for FIR filters 
so that one can see what the compiler produces.  Point of 
course is to evaluate the expresiveness of the code versus
the speed of the compiled code.  Pretty basic implementations
of various windowing functions for upsampling filters and
the like.
